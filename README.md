# RAG based LLM Applications for Contract Advisory
 ### Overview
 - This project provides a comprehensive guide to developing and scaling Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) based Large Language Models (LLMs) for contract advisory applications.
 
 - It includes tools and resources for building production-ready LLM applications, focusing on optimizing performance and scalability. 
 
 - The project aims to bridge the gap between open-source and proprietary LLMs, offering a hybrid routing approach for seamless integration.
 
 - It also emphasizes the impact of LLM applications on product development, sharing insights into both first and second-order effects. 
 
 - This repository is designed to support developers in creating highly scalable and available LLM applications, leveraging advanced techniques for efficient model serving and evaluation.
