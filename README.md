# Building-RAG-based-LLM-Applications-for-Contract-Advisor
 Base LLMs (ex. Llama-2-70b, gpt-4, etc.) are only aware of the information that they've been trained on and will fall short when we require them to know information beyond that. 
 
 Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) based LLM applications address this exact issue and extend the utility of LLMs to our specific data sources.
